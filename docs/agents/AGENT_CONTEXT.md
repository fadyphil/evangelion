# AGENT_CONTEXT — injected into every sub-agent dispatch

This file is **pasted verbatim** into every implementer and reviewer prompt. It is the
single source of truth for scope, architecture, and standards. If any other document
(`docs/plans/`, `eva/`, `README.md`) disagrees with this file, **this file wins**.

## 1. Mission

Build the Flutter client for **Evangelion**, a bilingual (Arabic Smith & Van Dyck /
English NKJV) Sunday-School daily Bible reading platform. The backend already exists and
is complete; we are building only the client.

Repository: `/home/fady/Projects/evangelion`
Package name: `evangelion`
Toolchain: Flutter **3.47.4** / Dart **3.13.3** (stable). No FVM, no melos.

## 2. Locked decisions — NOT up for renegotiation

These were decided with the user. Do not re-litigate. Do not expand scope.

| # | Decision |
|---|---|
| 1 | **Six screens.** Library and Profile are **cut**. There is no passage library, no category system, no reflection history, no user profile. |
| 2 | **Live API** against `http://localhost:3000` for reading / quiz / result / streak. |
| 3 | **Login and onboarding are UI-only.** A `FakeAuthRepository` returns a seeded session. There is **no auth endpoint on the backend** and no login API call. |
| 4 | **Settings are local only** (`shared_preferences`). No server sync. |
| 5 | **No servant/admin portal.** Those backend routes stay untested from the client. |
| 6 | **Dark glassmorphic design system** per `docs/plans/03-design-system.md`, including the five mandatory performance mitigations in `docs/plans/09-quality-gates.md` §13. |

### The six routes

| Route | Screen | Data source |
|---|---|---|
| `/login` | Onboarding + login (email, password, social buttons) | `FakeAuthRepository` |
| `/` | Home — greeting, streak flame, today's-reading panel | **API** |
| `/reading` | Reading sanctuary, EN and AR, zero chrome | **API** |
| `/quiz` | Quiz with instant per-question feedback | **API** |
| `/result` | Result — score, streak, stat tiles | **API** (submit response) |
| `/settings` | Appearance, reading, about | local |

Routes carry **no `:passageId` parameter**. There is no library to browse, so the passage
is always *today's*. The quiz re-fetches to obtain fresh `already_answered` flags, because
the backend has **no `GET /readings/:id`** endpoint.

---

## 3. Architecture — clean architecture, strict

Dependency direction is strictly inward:

```
presentation  ──▶  domain  ◀──  data
```

`domain` imports **nothing** from `data` and **nothing** from Flutter.

### Layer responsibilities

```
lib/
  app/                     composition root: DI, router, bootstrap
  core/
    design_system/         tokens, theme, effects, widgets  (imported by everyone)
    common/                Result<T>, Failure, AppConfig
    network/               Dio client, interceptors, error mapper
    domain/                SHARED KERNEL — see below. PURE DART.
  features/<f>/
    domain/                PURE DART. this feature's USE CASES only
    data/                  models, data sources, repository implementations
    presentation/          bloc/cubit, pages, widgets
```

### Shared kernel — `core/domain/`

Six screens read the same handful of types. Without a shared kernel, `home`, `reading` and
`quiz` would each need `ReadingRepository`, which forces cross-feature imports and breaks
the purity gate in §7. So entities and ports **consumed by two or more features** live in
`core/domain/`, not inside any one feature.

```
core/domain/
  entities/
    scripture_verse.dart    Verse, ScriptureText          — home, reading
    question.dart           Question                      — home, quiz
    quiz_session.dart       QuizSession, QuizAnswer       — quiz, result
    streak_summary.dart     StreakSummary, TodayStatus    — home, result
    submit_result.dart      SubmitResult                  — quiz, result
    auth_session.dart       AuthSession                   — auth, app
    user_settings.dart      UserSettings, AppThemeMode    — settings, app
  repositories/
    reading_repository.dart  streak_repository.dart
    auth_repository.dart     settings_repository.dart
  usecase/
    usecase.dart            UseCase<In, Out>, NoParamsUseCase<Out>
```

`core/domain/` is **pure Dart** — no Flutter, no Dio. It declares the four ports and the
entities. `features/*/data/` implements the ports. `features/*/domain/` holds only that
feature's own use cases, which depend on the ports from `core/domain`.

**Placement test:** used by exactly one feature → that feature's `domain/`. Used by two or
more → `core/domain/`. Nothing enters `core/domain/` speculatively.

### SOLID — as testable obligations, not slogans

| Principle | Concrete obligation here |
|---|---|
| **SRP** | One reason to change per file. A cubit owns state transitions only. A mapper owns JSON→domain only. A repository owns transport orchestration only. No file that both fetches and builds widgets. |
| **OCP** | A new script language or question type is added by **adding a class and registering it**, never by editing a growing `if (language == …)` ladder. Bilingual-vs-localized payload differences go behind a `ReadingParser` seam. |
| **LSP** | Every `ReadingRepository` implementation honours the whole contract, *including the non-obvious parts*: never throws across the seam, always returns `Result`, treats HTTP 409 as a typed failure and never an exception. A `FakeReadingRepository` must be substitutable for `DioReadingRepository`. |
| **ISP** | Four narrow ports: `ReadingRepository`, `StreakRepository`, `AuthRepository`, `SettingsRepository`. A single fat `EvangelionRepository` is **forbidden**. Clients depend on the smallest interface that satisfies them. |
| **DIP** | `core/domain/` declares the ports. `features/*/data/` implements them. No `domain/` file ever names a concrete implementation, `Dio`, or `SharedPreferences`. |

### Feature independence

**No feature may import another feature — no exceptions.** Shared UI lives in
`core/design_system`; shared domain lives in `core/domain`. If you want
`features/reading/…` from `features/home/…`, the shared type belongs in `core/domain`.

---

## 4. Dart standards

### Effective Dart — mandatory

- `final` by default; `const` wherever the compiler allows.
- Exhaustive `switch` **expressions** over `sealed` classes / enums. No `if`-chains for
  state branching.
- **No `dynamic`** anywhere. `avoid_dynamic_calls` is enabled.
- Explicit types on every public API.
- Fire-and-forget futures use `unawaited()` from `dart:async` — never a bare expression
  statement that drops a `Future`.
- `debugPrint`, never `print`.
- No `!` unless provably non-null, with an adjacent comment saying why.
- Prefer constructor initialisers and `final` fields over `late`.
- Named parameters for anything with more than two arguments.

### Forbidden APIs — Flutter 3.47.4

| Never use | Use instead |
|---|---|
| `ColorScheme.surfaceVariant` | `surfaceContainerHighest` |
| `MaterialStateProperty` / `MaterialState*` | `WidgetStateProperty` / `WidgetState*` |
| `WillPopScope` | `PopScope` |
| `Color.withOpacity()` | `withValues(alpha:)` |
| `color.value` | `toARGB32()` |
| `MediaQuery.of(ctx).size` | `MediaQuery.sizeOf(ctx)` |
| `MediaQuery.of(ctx).padding` | `MediaQuery.paddingOf(ctx)` |
| `textScaleFactor` | `TextScaler` / `MediaQuery.textScalerOf` |
| `describeEnum` | `.name` |
| `ThemeData.backgroundColor` / `onBackground` | `surface` / `onSurface` |

**This list is a seed, not the enforcement.** `dart analyze` reports `deprecated_member_use`
natively and is the real gate. Adding new deprecated usage fails the build.

Remediation: `dart fix --apply --code=deprecated_member_use`

---

## 5. Backend contract — verified facts, not guesses

Base URL: `http://localhost:3000` (in-memory backend, zero infrastructure).
Prefix: `/api/v1`. CORS is wide open. Auth is **not** implemented — identity is a header.

### Identity headers — required on every request

| Header | Rule |
|---|---|
| `X-User-Id` | **Must be a non-empty, valid UUID string.** Empty string → **401**. Absent → **400**. |
| `X-Group-Id` | Required for reading + leaderboard routes. Integer string. Use **`3`**. |
| `X-User-Role` | Parsed but **never checked**. Send `kid`. Decorative. |

Missing required header returns **400, not 401**. Do not write client logic that
distinguishes "unauthenticated" from "bad request" on a missing header.

### Seeded working data (in-memory fallback)

| Entity | Value |
|---|---|
| Users | `11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111` (David Mina), `22222222-…` (Peter George), `33333333-…` (Mark Anton) — **all group 3** |
| Reading | `aaaaaaaa-aaaa-aaaa-aaaa-aaaaaaaaaaaa` — John 3:1-5 |
| Question | `bbbbbbbb-bbbb-bbbb-bbbb-bbbbbbbbbbbb` |

**Group 3 / John 3:1-5 is the only path that works end-to-end.** The in-memory fallback
fabricates non-UUID ids (`question-group-3`) for any other group or date, and
`POST /readings/:id/submit` then rejects them with `400 body/question_id must match format "uuid"`.

### Endpoints this client uses

```
GET  /api/v1/readings/today/en      X-Group-Id, X-User-Id?
GET  /api/v1/readings/today/ar      X-Group-Id, X-User-Id?
GET  /api/v1/streak/summary         X-User-Id
POST /api/v1/readings/:id/submit    X-User-Id, Content-Type: application/json
     body: { "question_id": <uuid>, "answer": "<letter>" }
```

### Response shapes

`GET /readings/today/{en,ar}` returns a **localized** shape:

```jsonc
{
  "reading_id": "uuid", "group_id": 3, "scheduled_date": "2026-10-02",
  "language": "ar",
  "reference": "يوحنا 3: 1-5",
  "translation": "Smith & Van Dyck (فانديك)",
  "verses": [{ "book_number": 43, "chapter": 3, "verse": 1,
               "text": "…", "text_clean": "…" }],   // text_clean is AR-ONLY
  "questions": [{ "id": "uuid", "sort_order": 1, "type": "mcq",
                  "prompt": "…", "options": { "A": "…", "B": "…" },  // FLAT strings
                  "points_value": 10,
                  "already_answered": false, "user_answer": null, "is_correct": null }],
  "is_fully_completed": false, "total_points_earned_today": 0, "current_streak": 4
}
```

`POST /readings/:id/submit` returns:

```jsonc
{ "question_id": "uuid", "is_correct": true, "points_earned": 10,
  "current_total_points": 10, "current_streak": 1, "longest_streak": 1,
  "reading_completed": true }
```

`GET /streak/summary` returns `{ current_streak, longest_streak, today_status,
today_completed, next_milestone, days_to_milestone, … }`.
`today_status` ∈ `completed | pending | off_day | broken`.

### Traps — the client must handle all of these

1. **Two different error body shapes.** Most routes: `{ "error", "message" }`.
   Some: `{ "statusCode", "code", "error", "message" }`. The error mapper must accept both.
2. **`text_clean` exists only in Arabic.** English localized responses have no `text_clean`
   key at all. Do not assume its presence.
3. **Duplicate submit → `409`.** The quiz must disable questions where
   `already_answered == true` rather than discovering this as an error.
4. **Streak fields only change when `reading_completed == true`.** A single correct answer
   does not advance the streak; finishing the reading does.
5. **`POST` without `Content-Type: application/json` → `415`.**
6. **`?date=` must be exactly `YYYY-MM-DD`.** Anything else is rejected.
7. **`X-User-Role` does nothing.** Never gate UI on it expecting server enforcement.

---

## 6. TDD protocol

### Red-first — required for

domain entities · `Result<T>` / `Failure` · use cases · API models and mappers ·
the **dual-shape error mapper** · the **header interceptor** · `FakeAuthRepository` ·
the settings repository · `evaScalerFor` · token and motion tables · **every cubit**
(using `bloc_test` + `mocktail`).

Procedure per behaviour:
1. Write the failing test.
2. **Run it and confirm it fails for the intended reason.** A test that fails to compile or
   fails on an unrelated assertion is not a valid red.
3. Implement the minimum to pass.
4. Refactor with the test green.

### Not red-first — widget and screen work

The user explicitly exempted UI from TDD. Widgets and screens get **behaviour tests,
widget tests, and golden tests** written alongside or after the widget, never a
test-first ceremony. Domain logic must **not** be buried inside a widget — if a widget
needs a conditional or calculation, extract it to a cubit or a pure function and TDD that.

---

## 7. Verification — run before reporting done

```bash
dart format --output=none --set-exit-if-changed lib test   # formatting
dart analyze --fatal-infos --fatal-warnings                # types + lint + DEPRECATION
flutter test                                               # full suite
```

Layer-purity gates (dependency inversion, mechanically):

```bash
# domain must not import Flutter, Dio, or http -> must produce NO matches
# (covers the shared kernel AND every feature domain)
rg "package:(flutter|dio|http)/" lib/core/domain/ lib/features/*/domain/

# no cross-feature imports -> must produce NO matches
rg "package:evangelion/features/" lib/features/ lib/core/ | rg -v "features/(\w+)/\1"
```

`rg` finding matches means the gate **fails**. Report zero matches.

**Backend must not be modified.** It is read-only reference material at
`/home/fady/Projects/EvangelionBackend`. Never write there. Never run migrations or
`npm install` there. If a task seems to require a backend change, **stop and escalate**.

---

## 8. Hard constraints

1. **Never** write outside `/home/fady/Projects/evangelion`.
2. **Never** modify `/home/fady/Projects/EvangelionBackend` in any way.
3. **Never** commit secrets, `.env` contents, or API keys.
4. **Never** add a dependency that is not listed as approved in the current task.
5. Work on the branch you were dispatched on. Do not merge to `main`.
6. Do not rewrite `docs/plans/` — a dedicated task owns that.
7. Prefer editing an existing file over creating a new one. New files only where the
   task specifies a path.

---

## 9. Reporting

End every report with:

- **Status:** `DONE` | `DONE_WITH_CONCERNS` | `BLOCKED` | `NEEDS_CONTEXT`
- What you implemented
- What you tested, and the actual pass/fail counts
- Files changed
- Self-review findings
- Concerns

### When to escalate — do not guess

Report `NEEDS_CONTEXT` if requirements, approach, or dependencies are unclear.
Report `BLOCKED` if the task needs an architectural decision with several valid answers,
if you cannot make progress reading the code, or if you are unsure the approach is correct.

**Bad work is worse than no work. You will not be penalised for escalating.**
